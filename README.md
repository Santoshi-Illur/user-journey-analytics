This project implements a **User Journey Tracking & Analytics Platform** similar to large-scale e-commerce systems (e.g., Amazon).
The goal is to **ingest, process, and analyze millions of user interaction events per day** and provide actionable insights through dashboards, user journeys, and funnel analysis.

Refer to [docs](./docs/README.md) for  detailed architecture documentation.
